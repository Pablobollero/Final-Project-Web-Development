                <p>Hi there! My name is Pablo, I am from Argentina living in London since 2020, and I will get you into a small trip around my life background.<br>
                I get my first desktop PC when I was 10 years old and since that I can not stop. That was something incredible. I remember it like yesterday, my mother bough an Olivetti M4-82 desktop PC, the BIOS was “Award Modular” with Windows 3.1 as an OS with a Pentium 60MHz and it’s incredible 8MB RAM...wow!.<br>
                Was then when I decided to check what the heck was all that info appearing in my screen before Windows starts, and I started off to investigate about MS-DOS and its commands, there my dreams working on PCs begun.<br>
                For a while I stopped my investigation due my growing process, I focused in other aspects of my life.<br></p>
